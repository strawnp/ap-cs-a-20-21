     * You are creating algorithms that are important to understand
     * in the context of arrays. To begin, you will be generating
     * randomized lists, one as an array and one as an ArrayList.
     * From there, you will be developing a series of methods that
     * you will call for each of the data structures you have
     * created. In total you will be writing 6 methods since there
     * are 3 calculations and 2 data structures to perform them on.
